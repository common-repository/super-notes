Create notes and assign it to selected users and locations. Add admin notes to posts, pages, plugins etc., and add permissions to notes for users.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add custom notes to any posts, pages, users, media elements, plugins and even more different elements. It comes with great customization options, and allows you to configure custom rules, choose notes locations and user permissions for any type of note.

Before you can add notes, you'll need to create "Note Type". Note Types allows you to create different categories (types) for notes you want to use on your website.

= Examples =

Let's suppose that you have some users with "Author" role that publish posts on your website. You can create "Authors Notes" Note Type, and assign all users with "Author" role to see notes in this Note Type. This gives you the possibility to display notes for specific users only.

Another example - let's say that you have dozens of plugins installed on your website. Some of them may require special attention, and it's important to not forget about some tasks every now and then. You can handle it with this plugin - simply create Note Type and configure "location" option to allow adding single notes to plugins only!

= How it works? =

When your Note Type is correctly configured and published, you can add new note in the locations selected for this Note Type. Simply click on "Show" button near the element you want assign note to, and create your note. You can also add notes to global location, which means it will be always available after click on top admin bar element. And of course, you can manage notes assigned to single post, page and other elements in "Edit" screen of this element.

Custom users permissions and location rules can be combined, so you can create unlimited combinations of Note Types in premium plugin plan. Feel free to go to Note Types page and play with different configuration options to find out what fits you well :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to preview all my notes? =
